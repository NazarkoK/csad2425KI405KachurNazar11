# a. detalis about repo
  This repository was created to host the laboratory works of Kachur Nazar, a student of KI-405 group, from the CSAD course. In the future, it will contain ready-made laboratory works from the initial stages to the work program, which will be the end of the course.
	
# b. task detalis
  The goal of the project is to develop a digital version of the classic and well-known Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3) game. The result is an interactive and intuitive platform where two players can compete by placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
	
# c. student number and detalis
  Since I am the 11th student in the group, my assignment will look like this:
  | Student number  | Student       | Game            | Config format |
  | ----------------| --------------|-----------------|---------------|
  | 11              | Kachur Nazar  | Tik-Tac-Toe 3x3 | JSON          |
	
# d. detalis about technology, program language and HW
  In this project, I am going to use a client-server architecture. The server, which will provide data to the client program, will be represented by an Arduino board (I will announce the specific model later). The Arduion board will perform calculations and return the results to the client program at the end. The language for the project development will be Java or C++/C# (no final decision has been made at this time). Note that there may be changes during project development.
